# Contributing to the ASEAN Journal on Science & Technology for Development

AJSTD publishes articles from academics, policy makers, researchers, and managers, from either public institutions or private organizations and industry. These articles can be either original research, science and technology policy discussions, or technical notes and communications, but they are in their way responsible for shaping social, scientific, technological, and economic development in the ASEAN region. Owing to the multidimensional nature of technology, AJSTD accepts articles from a wide range of fields, including (but not limited to) biotechnology, non-conventional energy research, materials science and technology, marine sciences, meteorology and geophysics, food science and technology, microelectronics and information technology, space applications, science and technology policy, and infrastructure and resources development.

## Considerations before submitting

Before submitting an article to AJSTD, please ensure that it fits within the journal's scope and at the very
least fulfills all of the following criteria:

- It is written in English;
- It has not already been published, and is not under consideration by another journal;
- It is original research, discusses science and technology policy in the ASEAN region, or is a technical note
or communication; and
- It presents important findings that can impact scientific and technological development in the ASEAN
region, or presents innovative solutions to the technological challenges faced by ASEAN member countries
and has the potential to affect policy change and/or economic development in Southeast Asia.

If you feel your article is a good fit for AJSTD, you can get started by reading our author guidelines (found
