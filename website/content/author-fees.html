<p>The <i>ASEAN Journal on Science & Technology for Development</i> charges no fees whatsoever. This applies to both submission and publication of the article, as well as non-standard academic content, such as full-color figures and long article lengths&mdash;no costs are ever borne by authors.</p>
 
<p>This is made possible by the joint support of the <a href="http://asean.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASEAN Committee on Science and Technology</a> and <a href="https://www.kemdikbud.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia</a>, which enables us to operate without charging authors or readers.</p>
